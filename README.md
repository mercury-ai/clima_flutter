<h3>CLIMA-FLUTTER</h3>
<p>This is a simple weather app designed for both iOS and Android, developed entirely using Google's <a href='https://flutter.dev/docs'>Flutter  API</a>.</p>
<p>This app tells you the weather details of your location by default, and has the option to check the weather details of whatever city you want.</p>
<p>Here, I've used the <a href='https://openweathermap.org/api'>Open Weather Map API</a> for fetching the weather data.</p>
<br>
<p>So, that's about it :)</p>
